We're planning a [Data Rescue event] in the Washington DC area, and are using this space as a way to gather notes about who wants to be involved, possible places where we could hold the event, and other logistical details.

The idea is for [#datarescueDC](https://twitter.com/search?q=datarescueDC) to be an event based on the [workflow model](https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/blob/master/README.md) developed at [#datarefugePhilly](https://twitter.com/search?q=datarescuePhilly).

## Get Involved

We're coordinating and planning in the [DataRefuge Slack](https://datarefuge.slack.com), specifically in the #datarescueDC channel. If you'd like an invite please email [datarefuge@ppehlab.org](mailto:datarefuge@ppehlab.org).

See below to sign up for a specific team that matches your skillset. 

## Event Description

Over the course of two days, DataRescueDC will help to seed, sort, harvest, and store data in Data Refuge, a project facilitated by the University of Pennsylvania's Program in Environmental Humanities.

#### Saturday, February 18th: 12pm to 6pm   (setup time: 2 hours)
Saturday's sessions will include a teach-in featuring Georgetown professors, a Guide training for Sunday's team leaders, a round table on open data literacy, and a light reception featuring artists from the DC community. 

#### Sunday, February 19th: 10am to 5pm     (setup time 2 hours)
Sunday's sessions would include a creative coding and archive-a-thon, followed by a reception.

* How important has reliable wi-fi and access to power strips been for other events?
* Should the event be in DC proper?
