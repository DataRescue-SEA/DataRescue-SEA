Over the course of two days datadescueDC will help to seed, sort, harvest, and
store valuable and at risk federal government data in [Data Refuge], a project
facilitated by the University of Pennsylvania's Program in Environmental
Humanities. Specifically we will be using this [workflow
model](https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/blob/master/README.md)
developed at the first DataRescue event in Philadelphia, and which has been
further refined at events in Los Angeles, Chicago and Ann Arbor.

Whether you are a researcher who actively uses federal datasets, someone who
values the data publishing work the federal government, a software developer,
designer, or writer who we've got work for you to do, and would love for you 
to be involved.

## Schedule

#### Saturday, February 18th: 12pm to 6pm

Saturday's sessions will include a teach-in featuring Georgetown professors, a Guide training for Sunday's team leaders, a round table on open data literacy, and a light reception featuring artists from the DC community. 

#### Sunday, February 19th: 10am to 5pm

Sunday's sessions would include a creative coding and archive-a-thon, followed by a reception.

## Get Involved

We're coordinating and planning in the [DataRefuge Slack], specifically in the 
#datarescueDC channel. If you'd like an invite please email [datarefuge@ppehlab.org](mailto:datarefuge@ppehlab.org).

See below to sign up for a specific team that matches your skillset. At the
moment signing up involves going over to [GitHub] and editing [this markdown
file] in your browser. If that sounds intimidating don't let that stop you, 
just drop into [Slack] and let someone else know who will edit it for you.

## Data Rescue Teams

Each Data Rescue team needs a "guide" or team lead. (Multiple guides/leaders
welcome!) If you have skills in one of these areas, add your name below the team
as appropriate. If you want to be the guide for one of these areas, indicate
that as well. If you'd rather remain anonymous for now just show up, and we'll
figure it out from there.
