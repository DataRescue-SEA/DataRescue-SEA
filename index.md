Over the course of two days datadescueDC will help to seed, sort, harvest, and
store valuable and at risk federal government data in [Data Refuge], a project
facilitated by the University of Pennsylvania's Program in Environmental
Humanities. Specifically we will be using this [workflow
model](https://github.com/datarefugephilly/workflow/blob/master/README.md)
developed at the first DataRescue event in Philadelphia, and which has been
further refined at events in Los Angeles, Chicago and Ann Arbor.

Whether you are a researcher who actively uses federal datasets, someone who
values the data publishing work the federal government, a software developer,
designer, or writer who we've got work for you to do, and would love for you 
to be involved.

## Schedule

#### Saturday, February 18th: 12pm to 6pm

Saturday's sessions will include a teach-in featuring Georgetown professors, a Guide training for Sunday's team leaders, a round table on open data literacy, and a light reception featuring artists from the DC community. 
Guide training: 1:30-4pm

#### Sunday, February 19th: 10am to 5pm

Sunday's sessions will include a creative coding and archive-a-thon, followed by a reception. Please bring a fully charged laptop and a charger.

## Get Involved

We're coordinating and planning in the [DataRefuge Slack], specifically in the 
#datarescueDC channel. If you'd like an invite please email [datarefuge@ppehlab.org](mailto:datarefuge@ppehlab.org).

## Data Rescue Teams

Guides will take you on these Paths: choose one according to your interests and skills. If you have skills in one of these areas and want to serve as a guide, please sign up [here]. If you'd rather remain anonymous for now just show up, and we'll
figure it out from there.

### Seeding & Sorting
Feeding the End of Term Archive: This is the widest path and requires a variety of skill levels. Consider this path if you are a coder, hacker, have front end web experience, or just have a great attention to details.

### DataRefuge Path: the various interwoven paths to get "uncrawlable" data into DataRefuge
  -Researchers (to review URLs the Seeders & Sorters mark as Uncrawlable): Consider this path if you have a strong front end web experience and like to find out more information about thing.

  -Harvesters (to figure out how to capture the uncrawlable data): Consider this path if you're a hacker

  -Checkers (to inspect a harvested dataset and make sure that it is complete): The main question the checkers need to answer is "will the bag make sense to a scientist"? Checkers need to have an in-depth understanding of harvesting goals and potential content variations for datasets.

  -Baggers (to do a quality assurance check and package the data): Consider this path if you have data or web archiving experience, or have strong tech skills AND attention to detail.

  -Describers (includes a few people from the Baggers path): Consider this path if you have experience working with scientific data (particularly climate or environmental data) or with creating metadata. Trained librarians and scientists will be very helpful on this path.

### Documentation & Storytelling
Consider this path if youâ€™re on social media (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, whatever), if you can use Storify, if you have good listening and writing skills, and/or if you can make creative and engaging materials.
